# 📸 Adding Your Photos to the Website

## Quick Steps:

### 1. Save Your Photos
Right-click on each attached image and save them to:
```
/Users/ibrahimfakhry/Desktop/cv/static/images/
```

Save them as:
- **photo1.jpg** (the photo with you teaching at the laptop)
- **photo2.jpg** (the photo at the conference table)

### 2. The website will automatically use these photos in the gallery!

The gallery is set up to show:
- Your main profile photo (photo1.jpg - featured large)
- Conference photo (photo2.jpg)
- And will duplicate them for a complete gallery

### Alternative: Manual Naming
If you prefer, you can name them directly as:
- **profile.jpg** - Your main photo for the hero/gallery
- **teaching1.jpg** - Teaching moment photo
- **conference1.jpg** - Conference photo

## 🎨 Image Requirements:
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: Ideally 1000x1000px or larger
- **Keep file sizes under 500KB** for fast loading

## ✨ Your Photos Will Appear:
1. **Hero Section** - Subtle background effect
2. **Gallery Section** - Main showcase with your teaching and conference photos
3. **Hover effects** - Beautiful overlays when visitors hover

## 🔄 After Adding Photos:
Just refresh your browser - no need to restart the server!

**Note**: The website has fallback images in case photos aren't found yet, so it will work either way!
